However, platform-level options from `sensor:` and `switch:` YAML blocks (such as `monitored_conditions`, `command_on`, and `command_off`) cannot be imported automatically and have been set to their defaults. Please review the integration options in **Settings \u2192 Devices & Services \u2192 ZoneMinder \u2192 Configure** and adjust as needed.\n\nYou can now safely remove all ZoneMinder YAML from your `configuration.yaml`:\n- The `zoneminder:` top-level block\n- Any `sensor:`, `switch:`, or `camera:` platform entries for `zoneminder`"
